        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
        <div class="lyrics">
            <p>This night is cold in the kingdom</p>
            <p>I can feel you fade away</p>
            <p> the kitchen to the bathroom sink and</p>
            <p>Your steps keep me awake</p>
            <p>Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste</p>
            <p>I once was a man with dignity and grace</p>
            <p>Now I'm slippin' through the cracks of your cold embrace</p>
            <p>So please, please</p>
            
            <br>
            <div class="refrain">
                <p>Could you find a way to let me down slowly?</p>
                <p>A little sympathy, I hope you can show me</p>
                <p>If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely</p>
                <p>If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly</p>
                <p>Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down</p>
                <p>Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down</p>
                <p>If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely</p>
                <p>If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile</p>
            <p>As I'm walking down the corridor</p>
            <p>And I know we haven't talked in a while</p>
            <p>So I'm looking for an open door</p>
            <p>Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste</p>
            <p>I once was a man with dignity and grace</p>
            <p>Now I'm slippin' through the cracks of your cold embrace</p>
            <p>So please, please</p>
            <br>
